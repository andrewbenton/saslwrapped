### SaslWrapped

This library is inspired by [python-sasl](github.com/cloudera/python-sasl) and seeks to simplify the use of SASL within D.  Included is a static binding to Cyrus-SASL.  If I get time, I'll add an alternative backend to GSASL.

This library binding hasn't been extensively tested, but works on my machine.  I could especially use some help from anyone that wants to provide better support for Windows.
